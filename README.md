<font face="Georgia" size="5">
    In Maduravoyal, public food shelters and hunger-relief efforts are supported through a combination of government initiatives and local charitable organizations. Though there may not be a dedicated public food shelter in the area itself, nearby facilities operated by the Greater Chennai Corporation offer night shelters that often include food for the urban homeless. Nonprofits like Pephands Foundation and Chennai Food Bank regularly distribute meals and groceries to underprivileged communities across the city, including Maduravoyal. Religious institutions such as temples and churches in the area also conduct free meal programs (annadanam) for devotees and those in need. Community kitchens and food distribution drives are occasionally organized by local NGOs, especially during festivals or emergencies. The Tamil Nadu Public Distribution System (PDS) provides subsidized food grains to low-income families through ration cards. Additionally, online directories like GracesList Chennai list nearby free meal services. Volunteers and residents often contribute to these initiatives, ensuring that no one in the community goes hungry.
